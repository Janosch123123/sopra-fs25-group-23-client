## 🚀 Local Setup

If you want to run our project locally, you will first need to clone this repository.

Additionally, you will need Node.js

We were urged to install the exact version v20.11.0 that also comes with the npm package manager. You can download it here.

After installation, update the npm package manager to 10.4.0 by running npm install -g npm@10.4.0

You can verify that you are using the correct version by running node -v and npm --version

Before you start our application, run this command to install all other dependencies, including React:

npm install

In some cases, not all dependencies will be installed. The terminal will inform you which ones are you missing, install also with npm install <dependency-name>

Then you can start our frontend application with: npm run dev

Now you can open http://localhost:3000/ to view our app in the browser. The page will reload whenever you make modifications to our code. The terminal will also display lint errors in the console. The Client is ready but you also need to run the server for our app to work. Refer to the server's Readme on instructions how to setup and start it. Release.
